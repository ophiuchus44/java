# java


This is a practice java file for cs 401. To run, first you have to compile the .java file. In terminal, after downloading the file, change directory/or use filepath to compile. 

1) 'javac (path to file)/javaScannerReview.java'
or

1) 'cd (path to file)'
2) 'javac javaScannerReview.java'

A .class file will be created in the directory. Now, to run the .class file, we have to run it through a JRE or java runtime enviornment. 

1) 'java javaScannerReview' (note that you do not need the .class portion of the file)


Once running, each step requires 'Enter' when prompted.
